# SunStorm

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for processing experimental data of the SunStorm paper.

The derived data has already been computed and saved as `cache.csv` files, so the graphs can be plotted without the raw data. However, you can find the raw data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmXVgZEhOG5NvEzVuUtOKxPMX-O3ACWm/view?usp=sharing).
